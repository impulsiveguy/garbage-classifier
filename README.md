# ♻️ TrashNet CNN – Garbage Classifier using Deep Learning

A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built and trained from scratch using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify images of waste into six categories:  
`cardboard`, `glass`, `metal`, `paper`, `plastic`, and `trash`.

This project also includes a **Streamlit web app** for real-time waste classification.

## 📦 Project Overview

The goal is to automatically classify different types of recyclable waste from images using a CNN trained on the **TrashNet dataset**.  
The model is trained with advanced data augmentation and regularization for better generalization.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ **End-to-end training** from scratch (no pretrained backbone).
- 🧩 **Stratified data split** ensuring balanced train/val/test sets.
- 🔄 **Advanced augmentations** (rotation, zoom, shift, shear, flips).
- ⚖️ **Class weighting** to handle dataset imbalance.
- 📉 **Callbacks**: Early stopping, learning rate reduction, model checkpoint.
- 📊 **Visualization**: Training curves and confusion matrix.
- 🌐 **Streamlit UI** for easy waste classification via image upload.
